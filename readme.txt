Final

I made the main website parts as expected to get familiar with flask style.
My file layout had a static folder which included a CSS style sheet that 
allowed me to create a navigation bar for the website. 

My favourite website link was made with the href tag, while the other two
weblinks went to a particular app route link.

The first link I attempted to make a web crawler to obtain covid data and
perform some pandas operations on it. I will also try to make some pretty plots

The second link will be a song recommender. It will interact with Spotify and
pick out a random song from a provided artist. I will attempt to see if I can
also play a preview. 

(Ideas for extending the second link would be to curate the artists searched
and build up a recommendation scheme using sklearn. Possible datapoints: genre,
song length, presence in charts)
