Final

I made the main website parts as expected to get familiar with flask style.
My file layout had a static folder which included a CSS style sheet that 
allowed me to create a navigation bar for the website. 

My favourite website link was made with the href tag, while the other two
weblinks went to a particular app route link.

The first link I attempted to make a web crawler rowing medal data around the 
2016 Olympic year from Wikipedia. I merged the two dataframes that I obtained
from the website tables and found the medal differences. I thought this would
be an interesting starting avenue into analysing which nations may give more
lenience/time off to their athletes after an Olympic year.

The second link will be an experiment in using web APIs. I found an interesting
list of them on https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/
I decided on using the beer recipes API since it seemed the most straightforward
to use, avoiding OAuth use and having to create an account.
I decided to just display the name, description and food pairing.
